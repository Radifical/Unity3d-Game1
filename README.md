 # Unity Physics Based Game 
Programmed and designed a hyper casual mobile game from scratch using the Unity game engine and C#.

## About The Project



The goal is to get your jumping cube character to the bottom of the level, by breaking through orange gates. Players can try their best to move quickly and earn the rocket powerup, which will boost through the platforms automatically. Players lose when the cube doesnâ€™t jump high enough before trying to break through a gate, or when the character hits a white platform.

Main Features include:
- Unique gameplay
- Level & score system
- UI panels and smooth animations
- Player shop
- Mobile controls
- Powerup
- Sound effects
